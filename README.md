## Project Overview
This project is designed and developed by group10 with the aim of implementing a hybrid blockchain Django solution for freight supply chain management. It enables secure product creation for company registered clients or producers,shipment tracking, booking confirmations, and payments using Ethereum smart contracts, while providing a user friendly interface with Django and Stripe integration. Key features include immutable payment records, shipment provenance, and automated reporting for admins and users.<br>
The project tracks product creation for registered company clients and producers, freight shipments, booking confirmations, and payments using a hybrid architecture:
- **Django backend** for authentication, quotes, bookings, and system configuration (PostgreSQL database)
- **Local Ethereum blockchain (Ganache)** for immutable storage of products, payments, shipment records, and status updates
- **MetaMask** for ETH-based payments and transaction signing or pay for gas
- **Remix + MetaMask** for smart contract deployment and interaction on Ethereum test networks

6a. **Optional: Run the Project Using Docker**  
- If you prefer not to manually install Python, PostgreSQL, or Ganache, you can use Docker to run the entire application in containers:

   - Make sure Docker Desktop is installed and running.
   - Navigate to the project root folder:  
      ```bash
      cd Blockchain-Freight-SupplyChain
      ```
   - Build the Docker containers:  
      ```bash
      docker-compose build
      ```
  - Start the application stack (Django + PostgreSQL + Ganache):  
      ```bash
      docker-compose up
      ```
  - Access your application using the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8000)
  - Stop the containers anytime with:  
      ```bash
      docker-compose down
      ```
    
7.  **Install**
     - Web3.py via virtual Python environment. so as to open up communication between our appliactaion and blockchain service(Ganache)
     - Vscode: To edit and write your python codes
     - Remix IDE : is a browser-based development environment used to write, edit, compile, run, and deploy smart contracts written in Solidity. It provides built-in tools for testing, debugging, and interacting with contracts, making it especially useful for beginners and rapid prototyping. Remix supports deployment to local blockchains, test networks, and the Ethereum mainnet, and integrates easily with wallets like MetaMask for transaction signing
     - MetaMask Wallet : is a popular crypto wallet and browser extension that allows users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. It also acts as a gateway to decentralized applications, enabling secure interaction with blockchain networks directly from a web browser or mobile device.
     - Ganache : is a local blockchain simulator used for testing smart contracts.
  
 8. **Deploy smart contracts via Remix connected to Ganache or Polygon Amoy Testnet**

## Usage

- **Producer / Manufacturer** can create and register new shipments/products on the blockchain, request quotes, initiating the provenance record. Each creation triggers a `ProductCreated` blockchain event.  
- **Admin** (Regulator / System Authority) can manage users, roles, system settings, and audit all blockchain records for compliance.  
- **Clients / Consumers** can view their shipments, request quotes, confirm bookings, track delivery status, and verify product authenticity.  
- **Finance** team can handle payments, monitor transactions, generate financial reports, and verify payments on-chain.  
- **Sales / Distributor** team can create and manage bookings, quotations, and coordinate shipment operations.  
- **Warehouse / Logistics Handler** can update shipment status during storage and delivery (e.g., received, stored, dispatched), triggering `StatusUpdated` events on the blockchain.  

- Users can make payments shipping and block chain transaction fees using **ETH via MetaMask**. **Django --> MetaMask --> Solidity --> Ganache**
- All payment transactions and shipment status updates are **recorded on blockchain** for traceability, auditability, and provenance.  
- Account settings, quoting, documentation, and bookings are stored in **PostgreSQL** as off-chain services to optimize storage and performance.  
- Every shipment and payment action generates blockchain events (e.g., **`ProductCreated`, `OwnershipTransferred`, `StatusUpdated`**) to ensure a full **provenance trail** across the product lifecycle.
  
## Notes
- Smart contract logic is stored in blockchain/contracts/
- Smart contract Django-Ganache-MetaMask for **Payments transactions** is stored in **apps/Payments/**
- Smart contract Django-Ganache for **Shipment transactions** is stored in **apps/Shipments/**

## Smart Contract Structure & Interfaces
Our project uses three smart contracts on Ethereum to handle payments, shipments and product creation for company registered producers or clients securely:<br>

### Payment.sol

  - Manages all payment transactions for freight bookings.
  - Tracks each payment with details such as sessionId, transactionId, amount, currency, status (success/failed), payer, and associated shipmentId.
  - Supports payments via ETH through **MetaMask integration**.
  - Emits events like **PaymentCreated, PaymentProcessed, and EmailMarkedSent** to notify the system when a payment occurs, is confirmed, or a confirmation email is sent.
  - Ensures **traceability and auditability** by recording all payment events on-chain.
  - Only the contract owner can create and update payments, enforcing controlled and secure management through Django Interface.
  - Provides functions to query payment history for a shipment or blockchain transaction fees, supporting transparency for stakeholders.

### Shipment.sol
  - Handles creation, tracking, and status updates of shipments.
  - Stores shipment information like shipmentId, origin, destination, containerType, weight, status, and delivery confirmation.
  - Emits events such as ShipmentCreated, ShipmentStatusUpdated, and DeliveryConfirmed for real-time monitoring.
  - Only the contract owner can create or update shipments, maintaining integrity of shipment data.

### How Payment.sol and Shipment.sol work together:
- When a customer makes a payment (Payment.sol), it is linked to a freight quote.
- Once the payment is confirmed, a shipment record (Shipment.sol) is created and tracked until delivery.
- Events from both contracts allow the frontend to update the UI in real-time.

### ProducerProduct.sol
- Manages decentralized product registration and storage for supply chain systems.
  - Restricts product creation to **approved producers** only, ensuring controlled and secure access.
  - Allows the **contract owner (admin/producer/client)** to add or remove producers from the approved list.
  - Stores each product with details such as `id`, `name`, `description`, `timestamp`, and `producer address`.
  - Maintains an on-chain array of all products for transparent, immutable, and tamper-proof record keeping.
  - Provides read functions like `getProductCount` and `getProduct` to efficiently retrieve product data.
  - Emits `ProductCreated` events whenever a new product is added, enabling seamless integration with backend systems (e.g., Django) and real-time tracking.
